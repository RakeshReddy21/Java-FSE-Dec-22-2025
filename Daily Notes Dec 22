what can Media Queries test for --> 

    width : viewport width
    height: viewport height
    device-width : The screen heigh of a device
    orientation
    aspect-ratio : 16/9 --> The ratio of width to height based upon viewport width and height
    Color
    color-index 
    resolution
    grid

@media (hover){}
@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark)

Flexible, Flexible images, Layouts

Fluid layouts --> better than fluid layout flexbox is better --> Grid is better than flexbox


Flex box 
    --> It can be easily vertically center contents
    --> It can change the visual order of elements
    --> It can automatically space and align elements within box, automatically assigning available between them.
    -->Items can be laid out in a row and also show in the reverse direction

display: flex --> The flex box
flex --> The flex property
    Flex-grow
    flex-shrink
    flex-basis

flex-grow --> The amount. in relation to the other flex items, the flex item can grow when free space is available
flex-shrink --> is the amount the flex item can shrink, in relation to the other flex items, when there is not enough space
flex-basis --> Is the basis size the flex item is sized.
flex-flow --> row  wrap is a short cut for flex-direction and flex-wrap


Grid

explicit grid
implicit grid

1. Set up a grid
    grid-template-rows
    grid-template-columns
    grid-auto-rows
    grid-auto-flow
